# Task Manager CLI Application

## Project Description

The Task Manager is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application to help manage your tasks. It allows you to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. All tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file, which is loaded when the application starts and saved automatically when tasks are updated.

This project demonstrates basic task management functionality while focusing on file handling using JSON and implementing a user-friendly CLI.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Add a new task with a unique ID.
- **View Tasks**: View a list of all tasks along with their completion status.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task by its ID.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Mark a task as completed by its ID.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load tasks from a `tasks.json` file, allowing you to resume where you left off.

## Steps to run the program

1. Navigate to the project directory task_manager
